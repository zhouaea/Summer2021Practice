# Version Control by Example Part 4: Best Practices
1. Review changes with diff often.
	- Right before you commit
	- Right after you pull changes
2. Make clean and descriptive commits
	- Do a commit for every single task; never have multiple tasks in one commit
	- Explain commits completely, don’t just say “bug fix” or “minor change”
	- Tag important commits so it is easy to come back to them later
3. Don’t comment out code
	1. You can just go back to a previous version history if you want to come back to a section of code later
